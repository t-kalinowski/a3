//! Error types for the rtemis-a3 library.
//!
//! All fallible operations return `Result<T, A3Error>`. The variants map onto
//! the three failure modes A3 distinguishes:
//!
//! - [`A3Error::Parse`]     — the input was not valid JSON
//! - [`A3Error::Validate`]  — the JSON parsed but violated A3 rules
//! - [`A3Error::Serialize`] — a valid A3 value could not be serialized
//!
//! A parse failure is deliberately *not* a validation issue: a file that is not
//! JSON has no path to report and nothing further to collect. Everything else
//! is collectable, which is why [`A3Error::Validate`] carries a list.
